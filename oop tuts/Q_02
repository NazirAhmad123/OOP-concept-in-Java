Create a new class for a bank account.
Create fields for the account number, balance, customer name, email, and phone number.
Create getters and setter for each.
Create two additional methods.
  1. To allow the customer to deposit funds (this would increment the balance field).
  2. To allow the customer to withdraw funds. (this should deduct from the balance field,
  		but not allow the withdrawal to complete if the balance is not sufficient.
        You will want to create various code in the main class to conform your code is working.
        add some System.out.println's in the two methods above as well.
